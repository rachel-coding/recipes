                        <li>5-8 shiitake mushrooms (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If using dried mushrooms, soak them in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft.  Cut off stems and slice caps into 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide strips.</li>

                    </ol>

                <h4>Sunshine Chicken</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>one tray of chicken legs, about 4-6 pounds</li>
                        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced or garlic powder to taste</li>
                        <li>1/2 c. soy sauce</li>
                        <li>1/2 c. ketchup</li>
                        <li>1/4 c. canola or corn oil</li>
                        <li>1/4 c. honey</li>
                        <li>1 tsp. dried basil</li>
                        <li>1/4 tsp. ground black pepper</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine all ingredients except chicken in a large bowl and stir to combine.</li>
                        <li>Add chicken to bowl and combine so that chicken is co with sauce.  Marinate for up to a day in refrigerator.</li>
                        <li>Place chicken in a single layer in a shallow baking pan and baste with sauce.  Bake uncovered in a 350-degree oven for one hour.</li>
                    </ol>

                        For less fat you can remove the skin of the chicken before adding it to the marinade and it still comes out delicious.  Yields 6-8 servings.
