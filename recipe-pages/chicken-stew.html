    <p>This dish is easy and especially satisfying on a cold day!</p> 
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes</li>
        <li>6 medium carrots</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. sesame oil</li>
        <li>garlic powder to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>ground red pepper to taste</li>
        <li>5-8 shiitake mushrooms (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>If using dried mushrooms, soak them in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft.  Cut off stems and slice caps into 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide strips.</li>
        <li>Put all ingredients into a large pot and stir to combine.   Cover and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, and then decrease heat to low.  Simmer for one hour, stirring once or twice.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and side vegetables.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you'd like to lessen the cooking time, you can also saute everything in the pot over medium-high heat for ten minutes, and then reduce the heat to low and simmer covered for about twenty minutes.  Yields 6-8 servings.
