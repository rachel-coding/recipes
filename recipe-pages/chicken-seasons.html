    <p>I prepare this when I need something easy and tasty for my family.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>one tray of chicken legs, about 4-6 pounds</li>
        <li>Morton's Season-All</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken legs in a single layer on a shallow baking pan lined with aluminum foil and sprinkle with Season-All to taste.</li>
        <li>Bake in a 350-degree oven for one hour.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        For less fat you can remove the skin of the chicken legs first before placing them on the baking pan.  Yields 6-8 servings.
